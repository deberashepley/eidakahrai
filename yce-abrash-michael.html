Oculus Blog Posted by Michael Abrash October 11, 2017 Share. I'm sitting in a small interview room with one of the smartest of the hundred-odd candidates I've interviewed so far this year at Oculus Research—and one of the hardest to get a clear Michael Abrash es un programador de videojuegos y escritor técnico especializado en la optimización de procesadores 80x86 usando lenguaje ensamblador. Not sure if this is the correct place to ask this, so feel free to delete or whatever. Anyway, we know what makes John Carmack. John Carmack, but what makes Michael Abrash. Michael Abrash?

Michael Abrash is a programmer and technical writer specializing in code optimization and 80x86 assembly language , a reputation cemented by his 1990 book Zen of Assembly Language Volume 1: Knowledge and a monthly column in Dr. Dobb's Journal in the early 1990s. A later book, Zen of Graphics. Only I think this sentence is a joke? No one has ever asked for a Cv2 now  they were asking for a radical improvement. After 3 years of Cv1 it would have been the minimum wage. Facebook can afford to release both an Oculus S and an Oculus S + for the medium-high range. No more excuses and teasing  keeping the current characteristics locked for another 2 years is unthinkable. It is not acceptable. In his latest presentation at Oculus Connect 5, Oculus Chief Scientist Michael Abrash took a fresh look at the five-year VR technology predictions he made at OC3 in 2016. He believes his often-referenced key predictions are "pretty much on track," albeit delayed by about Here is the video: https://youtu.be/AtyE5qOB4gw?t=628 I found it interesting that abrash said in order to get over 100 degrees without distortion a breakthrough in optics is needed. This was in 2016. It sounds like Pimax achieved this and well beyond? and StarVR being almost entire FOV. The reviews I am reading and watching on youtube are looking very promising for Pimax and StarVR. Also there was a Jason Rubin podcast yesterday Michael Abrash - Technical Writer. Michael Abrash was a columnist in the 1980s for a magazine called Programmer's Journal . Abrash also showed how elusive performance improvement Here is the video: https://youtu.be/AtyE5qOB4gw?t=628 I found it interesting that abrash said in order to get over 100 degrees without distortion a breakthrough in optics is needed. This was in 2016. It sounds like Pimax achieved this and well beyond? and StarVR being almost entire FOV. Also there was a Jason Rubin podcast yesterday ( (he's from Oculus) and he says that variable focus is too expensive and too many moving parts for VR curre.

Michael Abrash's classic Graphics Programming Black Book is a compilation of Michael's writings on assembly language and graphics programming (including from his "Graphics Programming" column in Dr. Dobb's Journal). Is my calculation correct if I divide 4000 by the total field of view? 4000/140=28? How do you get the total field Mode X is an alternative graphics display mode of the IBM VGA graphics hardware that was popularized by Michael Abrash. It was first published in July 1991 in Dr. Dobb's Journal, and republished in chapters 47-49 of Abrash's Graphics Programming Black Book (now freely available online). Are you happy or dissatisfied? Amazed or disappointed? For me it's a bit of everything. I'm going to look back in 4 years and be absolutely, positively glad that VR set down this exact path rather than the divergence resulting in a 2020 Rift with Abrash's predictions. Because it will be a lot better than even that. Foveated Rendering was something that many people doubted could deliver more than 3-4x pixel reduction performance. Abrash went on saying 10x or more in 2016 which is already game-ch. 
Oculus Chief Scientist Michael Abrash recently presented at the third Global Grand Challenges Summit, sponsored by the US National Academy of Engineering, the UK Royal Academy of Engineering, and the Chinese Academy of Engineering, in Washington, DC. Today, we're excited to share Can someone go over each one stating a year? Because I'm a bit confused when he says within 4 years and wonder if that's referring Today, augmented reality is the stuff of Pokemon and puppy-face filters, but someday, it will be socially acceptable to wear high-tech AR glasses tying us to the virtual world around the clock. At least, that's according to Michael Abrash, Chief Scientist at Oculus Research. 
The way he talked about waveguides and pancake lenses was that they allowed for extremely high resolution and especially in the case of waveguides retinal resolution. So what exactly does this mean? Can we skip the usual higher resolution displays that get us incremental jumps? It seems like it must be a way around that because Oculus Rift already supports retinal resolution in the sense that you can manufacture a future 16K display to put inside.

Though, with that said, I’m also aware that it’s a great reference for graphics programming, with an emphasis in high performance C/assembly programming. My question is: is it worth the investment (I do not like ebooks so if I were to get it, I’d buy a paper-copy)? Thanks. Visit Dr. Michael P. Abrash, pathologist in Farmington Hills, MI.

I remember seeing a infographic or roadmap showing where VR was heading over the next 10 years or so, with motion simulator, haptic feedback, scent simulation, greater field of view, variable focus depth and so on. Does anyone know what I am referring to? I was a tree infographic with small thumbnails if I recall properly. amp#x200B; Thanks a lot for your help.

Abrash went on to describe the commonality in computer vision technologies that VR and AR devices will enjoy in the future, as both types of hardware will be capable of rendering convincing mixed reality. Valve is the dominant player in PC gaming, and its Vive VR system — co-developed by HTC — is still a very niche affair.
